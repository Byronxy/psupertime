# Psupertime

:wave: Hello User! :wave:

Psupertime is an R package which uses single cell RNAseq data, where the cells have a known ordering (which may be fuzzy), to identify a small number of genes which place cells in that known order. It can be used for discovery of relevant genes, for identification of subpopulations, and characterization of further unknown or differently labelled data.


## How to install / use

How to use this development version of the package:

1) In terminal or Git Bash, get the code from here:
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.ethz.ch/wmacnair/psupertime.git
```

2) In R, 
```R
devtools::install('/path/to/psupertime')
library('psupertime')
```

This should load all of the code and relevant documentation.
